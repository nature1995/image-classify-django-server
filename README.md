## Introduction  
A Keras deep learning image classifiers on Django server with REST API. It can help you quickly deploy and apply already trained models.

## Purposals  
Nowadays, more and more image recognition models have been designed, but most of the results are derived from simulations
 and are not applied to actual deployments. Through the actual application deployment, not only the performance of the
  model can be detected, but also the invisible problem of its existence can be detected. It can be of great help to
   model optimization and model improvement. The main purpose of this project is to build a Django web-based REST API
    model for deploying deep learning image recognition models while testing the performance of the model.

## Key words
Image classifiers, REST API
